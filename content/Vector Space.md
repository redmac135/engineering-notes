## Vector Spaces
set $V$ is a **vector space** if there are 2 operations:
- addition
- multiplication by scalar
that satisfy the following properties:
*addition properties*
1. $u,v\in V\Rightarrow u+v\in V$ 
2. $u+v=v+u$
3. $(u+v)+w=u+(v+w)$
4. There is an element $0\in V$ such that $u+0=u$
5. $u\in V\Rightarrow (-u)\in V$ such that $u+(-u)=0$
*multiplication properties*
1. $u\in V,c\in\mathbb{R}\Rightarrow{cv}\in{V}$
2. $c(u+v)=cu+cv$
3. $(c+d)u=cu+cd$
4. $c(du)=(cd)u$
5. $1\cdot u=u$

A vector space is defined as any set of elements which obey these properties.
