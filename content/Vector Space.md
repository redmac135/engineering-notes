## Vector Spaces

set $V$ is a **vector space** if there are 2 operations:

- addition
- multiplication by scalar
  that satisfy the following properties:
  _addition properties_

1. $u,v\in V\Rightarrow u+v\in V$
2. $u+v=v+u$
3. $(u+v)+w=u+(v+w)$
4. There is an element $0\in V$ such that $u+0=u$
5. $u\in V\Rightarrow (-u)\in V$ such that $u+(-u)=0$
   _multiplication properties_
6. $u\in V,c\in\mathbb{R}\Rightarrow{cv}\in{V}$
7. $c(u+v)=cu+cv$
8. $(c+d)u=cu+cd$
9. $c(du)=(cd)u$
10. $1\cdot u=u$

A vector space is defined as any set of elements which obey these properties.
